### Project for Day 1: The Command-Line Financial Oracle

This is the first milestone in a project to build a personal finance mentor, powered by Google's Gemini AI.

## About This Milestone

This script (`oracle.py`) is a simple command-line tool that connects to the Google Gemini API to answer basic financial questions.

**Key Features:**
* Connects securely to the Google Gemini API.
* Takes a hard-coded question about a financial topic.
* Prints the AI's response directly to the terminal.

## How to Run It

1.  **Set up the environment:** Make sure you have a Conda environment with the `google-generativeai` library installed.
2.  **Add your API Key:** Open the `oracle.py` file and paste your Google AI API key into the `api_key` variable.
3.  **Run from the terminal:**
    ```bash
    python oracle.py
    ```
